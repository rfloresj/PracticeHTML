<p>Same as color name "Tomato":</p>

<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71)">rgb(255, 99, 71)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">#ff6347</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">hsl(9, 100%, 64%)</h1>

<p>Same as color name "Tomato", but 50% transparent:</p>
<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)</h1>

<p>In addition to the predefined color names, colors can be specified using RGB, HEX, HSL, or even transparent colors using RGBA or HSLA color values.</p>

An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity).
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:
rgb(60, 60, 60), 
rgb(180, 180, 180)

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two 
(green and blue) are set to 00.

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity)
hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(0, 100%, 50%);">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</h1>

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an Alpha channel - 
which specifies the opacity for a color.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

n internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

<style>
        body {background-color: powderblue;}
        h1 {color: blue;}
        p {color: red;}
    </style>

<body style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></body>

External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

Tag	Description
<style>	Defines style information for an HTML document
<link>	Defines a link between a document and an external resource
--LINKS--

The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
Image as a link
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email)
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
Link to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: 
<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
Link to a page located in the same folder as the current page: 
<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program
<a>	Defines a hyperlink
-Link Bookmarks-
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

--HTML Images--
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera):
APNG	Animated Portable Network Graphics	.apng
GIF	Graphics Interchange Format	.gif
ICO	Microsoft Icon	.ico, .cur
JPEG	Joint Photographic Expert Group image	.jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp
PNG	Portable Network Graphics	.png
SVG	Scalable Vector Graphics	.svg

Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right

!Note: Loading large images takes time, and can slow down your web page. Use images carefully!

Tag	Description
<img>	Defines an image
<map>	Defines an image map
<area>	Defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture>	Defines a container for multiple image resources

The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map>

Shape
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region

You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. 

Background Image on a HTML element
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

Add a background image on a HTML element:

<p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

body{
    background-image: url('https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/06/21/21/56/konigssee-7276585_960_720.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-size: cover;
}
The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.
Show different images for different screen sizes:

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>
The img element is required as the last child tag of the picture declaration block.
The img element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags matched.
Note: The picture element is not supported in IE12 and earlier or Safari 9.0 and earlier.

There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:

1. Bandwidth
If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.

2. Format Support
Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.
